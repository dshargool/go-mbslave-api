# Modbus Slave API Frontend

## Pages
### Home
The home page displays a single element which is the status of the backend API.  If the API /healthcheck endpoint is available this status will show green.  If it is unavailable it will show red.
This allows for a quick check of the status of things without having to perform our own requests.

### Data
The Data page shows all currently configured registers and their values.

# TODO

- [ ] Page to add new tags to config/db
- [ ] Page to see all current registers/tags (and their values)
